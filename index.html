    <h1>Well, hello there</h1>

    <p>My name is Lathe, and I'm a fullstack engineer. I've been working at 
        Three Rivers Planning and Development District since September of 2021,
        shortly after graduating from Base Camp Coding Academy.
    </p>

    <p>
        While I was in school, I was able to make some cool projects in Python,
        Java, Django, Spring, and more. Base Camp is an 11 month program that's meant 
        to turn you into a professional developer that can perform at the same rate of
        a college graduate in a fraction of the time.
    </p>

    <p>
        Naturally, this was already pretty intense, but while doing moderately well,
        I gained an interest in Legacy languages such as COBOL, which is how I ended
        up at my current job.
    </p>

    <p>
        Listed on this site is a little bit about me and the projects I've done.
        I've separated my school projects and soon-to-be current projects for you so you can
        get a better idea of my day-to-day now. And of course, thank you for the visit.
        
    </p>
